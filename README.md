Note: I set this up so that the commit history would show how much time I spent on each part of this. It took longer than expected due to setting up TypeScript and testing and getting everything to run without error.

## To run

`npm run getPrices -- <commodity> <tons> <price per ton>`

### To run tests

`npm run test`
